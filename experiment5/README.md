As a flesh-based programmer who is really into Isekai (Japanese: 異世界), I've been wanting to create something like generates contents related to it. Seeing the example script "bad quests" has further motivated me to create a script that is similar yet produces contents that are different within the concept of Isekai. Then, the thoughts of a potion brewing course came to my mind, since having a variety of potions is an effective way to make an immersive experience for the Isekai world.

My goal is to have my script generate a magic potion brewing narrative centered around the mysterious process of creation. It begins with the origins of a particular potion, crediting its invention to a uniquely named wizard, combining elements of different first and last names to create a wealth of potential characters. The potions themselves are defined by their intended magical effect and feature naming conventions that reflect that effect, adding depth to the lore. Brewing instructions provide a detailed step-by-step guide that emphasizes on actions and ingredients. This format not only gives readers backstory, but also blends creativity with procedural storytelling through interactive magic potion brewing, inviting them into the imaginative world of magic.
